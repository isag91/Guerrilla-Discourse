MRTA Statement For May Day 1997 

Speech By Isaac Velazco International Representative Of The MRTA To The May Day Rally In Zurich Switzerland 

Dear comrades and friends 

In celebration of this years May Day I would like to greet all those workers who are determined to wage resistance against the inhumane model of capitalism neoliberalism We are told that ideology is dead that democracy has finally defeated socialist totalitarianism But today we can see that this is far from true that the contradiction between social labor and individual private profit has far from disappeared 

Neoliberalism is sharpening the contradictions by making the rich richer while millions of people around the world sink deeper into poverty Neoliberalism knows no boundaries To greater or lesser degrees of brutality this economic system is ruling the entire world both in the countries of the North and the South More than a century ago workers began to win social concessions from the capitalists The struggle for an 8hour workday created consciousness among the workers Out of a few individual demands grew a political struggle against exploitation and the contradictions between labor and capital In Peru the struggle for the 8hour day began in 1906 among the dock workers in Limas port of Callao They achieved this goal two years later The workers movement soon encompassed all of the production sector 

From the struggle of bakery and textile workers grew the trade union federation CGTP Its founder was Amauta Jose Carlos Maridtegui one of the first socialist thinkers in Peru and Latin America The union in the CROMOTEX textile factory was particularly exemplary When the factorys owners decided to bankrupt the factory to protect their own profits and ignore their responsibilities to the workers the union decided to peacefully occupy the plant Despite months of negotiations between the union and management there was no solution On February 4 1979 the owners decided to let the police storm the factory 6 workers were killed and one policeman died after falling from a second storey window Workers and trade unionists were arrested They were charged with attacking the security forces and killing a policeman Among those put on trial was Nestor Cerpa Cartolini After 8 months in prison Cerpa and the other jailed workers were released following public pressure 

The brutal attack on the peaceful factory occupation which had been undertaken to win the legitimate rights of the workers proved to Cerpa that rights could not be won by unions alone nor solely with peaceful and legal means The Peruvian state did not hesitate to use violence against trade unions It was against this background that Cerpa opted for revolution to resist Peruvian state terrorism with arms and to thereby win human rights for all Peruvians including the right to education health care culture and social justice 

For Nestor Cerpa and his campanerosas violence was not the goal but rather a means of achieving legitimate rights It its 15 years of struggle the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement MRTA has always placed great importance on respecting the Geneva Convention protecting the civilian population and treating its prisoners war and wounded captives with dignity In 1987 during the occupation of Juanjui in the Peruvian jungle Nestor Cerpa Cartolini handed over all prisoners of war and wounded persons to church officials so that they could receive medical treatment Among these prisoners were an officer and the son of the chief of the national antiterrorist police John Caro In 1991 following an armed clash with the national police in Rioja Cerpa took all 9 prisoners of war to the local bishop In numerous television broadcasts Nestor Cerpa Cartolini called on the Peruvian people to abide by the Geneva Convention and respect human rights With the occupation of the Japanese ambassadors residence in Lima on December 17 1996 Cerpa brought the logic of the armed struggle for all the world to see He also pointed out the insanity of an economic system that uses violence against its entire population to defend the interests of capital 

The embassy occupation brought international attention to the mechanisms and consequences of the neoliberal model the poverty of a majority of the population and the ceaseless exploitation of human and natural resources for the benefit of a small class of people with ties to international capital The embassy occupation of December 17 showed the insanity of the neoliberal economic system whose maintenance requires the use of state terrorism torture arbitrary imprisonment murder and the use of death squads 9000 men and women are held in inhumane conditions in prisons across Peru simply because they resisted against this system 

On April 22 1997 the residency compound which is on Japanese territory was stormed and all the members of our commando were executed This was done to protect in the eyes of the world this unscrupulous model of capitalism neoliberalism We must think of these things on this day the International Day of Labor 

Long Live May Day Long Live International Solidarity
