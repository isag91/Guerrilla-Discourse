FMLN COMMUNIQUE TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE

Concerning the warwounded guerrillas and the Amnesty Law the FMLN communicates the following

1 The Amnesty Law does not apply to the warwounded who are fully protected by international agreements

2 All the Amnesty Law intends to do is to make our compa√±eros look like delinquents because the fascist arrogance of the ARENA Party will not allow its members to admit that the FMLN war wounded are legitimately protected by international law and that the Cristiani Government is morally and legally obligated to comply with its international agreements

3 The obvious intention of the Cristiani Government to humiliate the warwounded demonstrates how difficult it is for the fascist reasoning of ARENA to reach accords that will lead to peace

They speak of reconciliation and they are not even capable of respecting the humanitarian rights of warwounded combatants 
What then are the chances for a negotiated political solution 
Fascist ideology will only recognize accords when it is to its benefit

The FMLN once again congratulates the dignity and correctness of the warwound guerrillas who are currently in the Mexican Embassy and we reiterate our open support for their decision to not accept a humiliating amnesty Humanitarian rights established in international agreements protect them
