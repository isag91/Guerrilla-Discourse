FMLN COMMUNIQUE THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE PROCESS FOR DIALOGUE   
   
In relation to the current situation in the process for dialogue the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front communicates the following

1 As an effort to reopen the process we have made the following initiatives in the last few weeks

a A meeting with the Permanent Committee for National Debate

b An informal meeting with representatives of various US political and social groups

c A meeting with representatives of the Cristian Democratic and National Reconciliation Parties and the parties of the Democratic Convergence
   
d A meeting with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias

e A letter to the Central American presidents when they met in Tela Honduras expressing our readiness to begin a direct dialogue with the government

g A request to the Secretary Generals of the United Nations and the Organization of American States Miguel Perez de Cuellar and Joao Baena Suarez respectively asking that they participate in the negotiation process in El Salvador as stipulated in the Tela Accords

2 The proposal to President Cristiani concerning aspects of procedure for the dialogue

In the letter sent to Mr Cristiani through the political parties we indicated that the Commission for Dialogue proposed by his government is not representative and lacking in decision making power giving the dialogue a low profile and taking it out of national context by planning it  outside of the country without the independent participation of other forces We see the exclusion of Monsenor Rivera y Damas as negative  Referring to the procedures we agree on the need to carry out a prepared dialogue between government officials Chiefs of the Armed Forces and the FMLN  We also agree that the dialogue should be carried out in private and outside the country but we propose the presence of international observers as well as those from political parties private businesses and the Permanent Committee for National Debate as invited guests or observers and with Monsenor Rivera Y Damas as moderator  We also insist on the need for efforts that contribute to create a favorable environment 

3  All these initiatives have had an exclusive character with the goal of avoiding real dialogue and using the occasion for propagandistic purposes taking away the seriousness of the situation We have taken into consideration the opinions and suggestions of various social and political forces and we have included several elements of Mr Cristianis plan

We believe that without flexible positions on both sides it will be difficult to open a real process of dialogue and negotiation

4  We are for dialogue that searches for negotiation and we are concerned about conditions developing in the country that do not contribute to it The economic measures and the increase of repression adopted by the government are not conductive for a dialogue On the contrary they have intensified the war and contradict the Tela accords which commit the governments of the region to democratization and reconciliation

It should be pointed out that all the steps toward the dialogue and the measures and procedures adopted must be agreed upon bilaterally and in private if its not done this way it will reduce the dialogue into a propagandistic show without positive results For our part we are willing to sit down seriously at the negotiating table to find a lasting solution to the conflict   
    
We are also concerned about the lack of unity in the government regarding the need for negotiation with the FMLN and the persistence in some sectors of the Armed Forces and the ARENA Party in seeking an FMLN surrender  
    
We urge all sectors to reflect and adopt a more realistic attitude To all sectors interested in peace we urge the search for finding ways leading to the broadest possible participation in the negotiation process
