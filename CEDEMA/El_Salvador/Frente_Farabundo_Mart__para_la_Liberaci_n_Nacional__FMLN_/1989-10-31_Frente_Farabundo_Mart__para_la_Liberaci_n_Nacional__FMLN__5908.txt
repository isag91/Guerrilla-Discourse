OCTOBER 31ST FMLN COMMUNIQUE       

In relation to the massacre at the FENASTRAS building, the FMLN declares the following:

1. We blame this cowardly crime on the Armed Forces High Command and Colonel Emilio Ponce, who in declarations yesterday promised to react to our attack on the Chief of Staff Headquarters. This confirms that the High Command is waging a war against the people as established at the San Jose talks in their concept of hostilities, in which the popular movement is considered to consist of support organizations for the FMLN.

2. This terrorist act, along with others committed at the University, homes of political leaders and the COMADRES offices, left 9 dead and 49 wounded and creates a new situation in the country which forces the popular movement to defend itself.

The FMLN had shown flexibility in its efforts to start a real negotiation process, but this unacceptable situation reaffirms the impossibility of abandoning the armed struggle.

3. These acts carried out by the High Command and the Tandona    endanger the talks in Caracas.  

We unite in the grief of the popular movement and FENASTRAS for the death of their comrades and especially their beloved leader Febe Elizabeth Velasquez.

All of these acts add to the list of crimes which these repressive forces have carried out for the past ten years. Only a strong, united and armed struggle will bring these criminals to justice.

ARENA AND THE TANDONA MEAN DICTATORSHIP AND WAR !!      
ALL AGAINST ARENA AND THE TANDONA !!

GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN
